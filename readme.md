# Pygit

### Now using Tkinter, maybe pyqt?

## Mac Binary
Use py2app precompiled binary (n00b and recomended):
[pygit.app](http://docscloud.me/download/50f1ecc20e958f946d000006)
Compile yours.

## Windows and Linux binaries
Someone can compile a .exe binary and send the file with a download url in a git issue?
